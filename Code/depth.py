"""
    In this code, we use a circular buffer to store the last window_size distance measurements and compute the moving average of those measurements. We then check for a sudden change in depth by comparing the current distance to the moving average, and if the difference is greater than a threshold (in this case, 10 cm), we alert the user with the vibrating motor. The alert_user function simply turns on the motor for half a second before turning it off again.

Note that this is just an example code and you may need to adjust the moving average window size and threshold to fit your specific requirements. Also, make sure to properly connect and configure the vibrating motor to the GPIO pin before running the code.
